# You have landed on "learn more about me" page!

Hi! 

My name is Zhiyu (Audrey) Wei, and I'm a Master of Public Health candidate at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. I majored in biochemistry during my undergraduate studies and switched to biostatistics for my master's education. 

My research interests lie in utilizing data analysis and statistical models to comprehend health-related datasets and in exploring how different statistical models can convey various messages regarding the data.
